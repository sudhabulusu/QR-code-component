## Overview

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I've tried my best to get as close to
the desktop design as possible, with the goal of coding my HTML and CSS to also match the mobile design.

## My process

My process was to do the HTML first, then the CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex


### What I learned

Some of what I learned:
- using flexbox to create a responsive display.
- using CSS Lint to validate my CSS and clean it up
- using the W3 HTML validator to check my HTML and clean it up -- I had a minor typo
prevented my CSS stylesheet link from working. Checking my HTML helped me fix it, and
then it was much easier to work on refining my solution.



### Useful resources

- [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) - This helped me validate my CSS and ensure my font colors would have a fallback hex color.
- [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML validator that caught a simple, yet frustrating, error (see the What I learned section above).

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Frontend Mentor and everyone who completed this solution and gave feedback to others. I read through many comments, and they were very helpful. Looking forward to participating in more Frontend Mentor challenges. I'm especially thankful to byKrissK, whose CSS flex code was simple and clear. I had trouble with padding, margins, and width  details of my responsive layout, and her code helped me figure it out.

Thank you to Dr. Angela Yu who teaches The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy. I am taking that course now and found Frontend Mentor through it.
